Swig based CMPI bindings
------------------------

This implements a CMPI-compliant provider interface for various languages via SWIG.

Currently supported languages

- Ruby
- Python
- Perl (beginning support)



Implementation
--------------
cmpi-bindings is implemented as a single CMPI-compliant provider (per supported language)
that serves as a "multiplexer" to the instrumented language-specific providers.

Using a python provider for class Py_Foo as an example, cmpi-bindings project provides a
cmpi-compliant provider (libpyCmpiProvider.so) that will be registered with the cimom as
the provider that handles Py_Foo requests.  When libpyCmpiProvider gets the request, it
will then forward it on to the python module that instruments the Py_Foo class.

cmpi-bindings also provides supported-language-interfaces for the Provider Environment
and BrokerCIMOMHandle, so that providers can make "up-calls" into the cimom.


For the stack discussion below, use the following 'type' abbreviations:
  Ruby:    rb
  Python:  py
  Perl:    pl

The cmpi-bindings provider interfaces under CMPI consist of the following stack:

CIMOM
  ->
lib<type>CmpiProvider.so
  ->
cmpi_<type>wbem_bindings.<type>
  ->
<python:  pywbem/cim_provider2.py>
  ->
language-specific provider module



Build / Installation
--------------------
The build scripts will only build the modules for which you have appropriate devel packages.
It will skip any others.

  Requirements
  ------------
  cmake
  python interface requires:  python-devel, pywbem-0.7.0
  perl interface requires: ?
  ruby interface requires: ruby-1.8 ruby-devel-1.8

  Build
  -----
  From root of tarball's source tree, create a directory 'build' and move (cd) into that directory
  'cmake ..'
  'make'
  'sudo make install'

  Test
  ----
  For each language, there is a test/<language> directory.
  Within that directory, there should be test providers, scripts that use the test providers, and
  scripts to register the mofs and providers with cimoms.
